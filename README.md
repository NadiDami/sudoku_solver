#Sudoku
##Makers Academy Week 4 Project


###Aim

The aim was to build an engine to solve Sudoku puzzles, using TDD

###Other details

The test was set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen, [@ecomba](http://www.github.com/ecomba)

I paired with Michael Bottjer, [@MBottjer](http://www.github.com/MBottjer)




###To do

The current repo is incomplete. We had originally spent a few days on the task, but poor design meant that we had to start again from the beginining. The pace of Makers Academy meant that I never got round to completing this solver, but I hope to come back to it once the course is over.

The plan is to give the cells the ability to solve themselves, by refining a list of potential candidates given the cells in its row, column, and block. The grid is merely a container for the cells, and iterates over them.
